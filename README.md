## Bus Trip Booking Service for Latin language speaking Foreigners in Korea

After the COVID-19 lock down, large number of foreigners are coming to South Korea.

South Korean government and organizations do support some foreign languages, such as English, Japanese and Chinese.

However, support for other languages like Spanish, French, and others are lacking.

Foreigners of those speaking languages want to explore all the beautiful places of the South Korea.

However, their tranportation is very limited.

Thus, we are to make a solid bus booking web service for foreigners to use.

Though, our system does not have any data of real bus system.

We are to make our booking system reflect the real system with the knowledges we learn throughout the course of COMP0332.

Our goal is to make "production-ready" bus booking system for Latin languages speaking foreigners.
